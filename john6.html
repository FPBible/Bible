  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 6 — The Bread of the New Creation</h2>

  <h3>The Feeding of the Five Thousand</h3>

  <p>
    After this, Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (also called the Sea of Tiberias),
    and a large crowd followed Him,
    because they saw the signs He was doing on the sick
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:1–2)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down with His disciples.
    The Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:3–4)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lifting up His eyes and seeing a great crowd coming toward Him,
    Jesus said to Philip,
    “Where can we buy bread, so these people may eat?”
    He said this to test him, for He Himself knew what He was going to do
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:5–6)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread wouldn’t be enough
    for each of them to get even a little.”
    One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said,
    “There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish,
    but what are they among so many?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:7–9)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.”
    There was plenty of grass in that place,
    so the men sat down, about five thousand in number.
    Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were seated,
    and likewise the fish, as much as they wanted
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:10–11)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When they were satisfied, He said to His disciples,
    “Gather up the leftover fragments, so nothing is wasted.”
    So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets
    with fragments from the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:12–13)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the people saw the sign He had done, they said,
    “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:14)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Perceiving that they were about to come and seize Him by force to make Him king,
    Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by Himself
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:15)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Jesus Walks on the Sea</h3>

  <p>
    When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,
    got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum.
    It was already dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
    The sea was stirred up because a strong wind was blowing
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:16–18)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    After they had rowed about three or four miles,
    they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat,
    and they were afraid.
    But He said to them,
    “It is I; don’t be afraid.”
    Then they willingly received Him into the boat,
    and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:19–21)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Crowd Seeks Him</h3>

  <p>
    The next day, the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea
    saw that there had been only one boat there,
    and that Jesus had not entered the boat with His disciples,
    but that His disciples had gone away alone.
    Other boats from Tiberias came near the place
    where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:22–23)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples,
    they got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
    When they found Him on the other side of the sea,
    they said to Him, “Rabbi, when did You come here?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:24–25)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus answered,
    “Amen, amen, I tell you,
    you are looking for Me not because you saw the signs,
    but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.
    Don’t work for the food that perishes,
    but for the food that endures to eternal life,
    which the Son of Man will give you.
    For God the Father has set His seal on Him”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:26–27)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The True Bread from Heaven</h3>

  <p>
    They asked Him,
    “What must we do, to work the works of God?”
    Jesus answered,
    “This is the work of God:
    that you believe in Him whom He has sent”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:28–29)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They said,
    “What sign will You do, so we may see and believe You?
    What will You perform?
    Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written,
    ‘He gave them bread out of heaven to eat’”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EXO16.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Ex 16:4)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA78.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Ps 78:24)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:30–31)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus said to them,
    “Amen, amen, I tell you,
    it wasn’t Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven,
    but My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.
    For the bread of God is the One who comes down from heaven
    and gives life to the world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:32–33)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They said, “Lord, always give us this bread.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus said to them,
    “I am the bread of life.
    Whoever comes to Me will never hunger,
    and whoever believes in Me will never thirst”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:35)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “But I told you that you have seen Me and still do not believe.
    All that the Father gives Me will come to Me,
    and the one who comes to Me I will never cast out.
    For I have come down from heaven,
    not to do My own will,
    but the will of Him who sent Me”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v36" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:36–38)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “This is the will of Him who sent Me,
    that I should lose nothing of all He has given Me,
    but should raise it up at the last day.
    For this is the will of My Father,
    that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him
    may have eternal life,
    and I will raise him up at the last day”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:39–40)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Jews Murmur</h3>

  <p>
    The Jews grumbled about Him because He said,
    “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”
    They said, “Isn’t this Jesus, the son of Joseph,
    whose father and mother we know?
    How can He now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v41" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:41–42)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus answered,
    “Stop grumbling among yourselves.
    No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him,
    and I will raise him up at the last day.
    It is written in the prophets, ‘They will all be taught by God.’
    Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA54.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Isa 54:13)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v43" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:43–45)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God;
    He has seen the Father.
    Amen, amen, I tell you,
    whoever believes has eternal life.
    I am the bread of life”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:46–48)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
    This is the bread that comes down out of heaven,
    so that anyone may eat of it and not die.
    I am the living bread which came down out of heaven.
    If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.
    The bread that I give for the life of the world is My flesh”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v49" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:49–51)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Eating His Flesh and Drinking His Blood</h3>

  <p>
    The Jews argued among themselves, saying,
    “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:52)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus said,
    “Amen, amen, I tell you,
    unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood,
    you have no life in yourselves.
    Whoever feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life,
    and I will raise him up at the last day.
    For My flesh is true food,
    and My blood is true drink”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v53" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:53–55)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Whoever feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him.
    Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father,
    so the one who feeds on Me will live because of Me.
    This is the bread that came down out of heaven
    — not as the fathers ate and died.
    The one who feeds on this bread will live forever”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v56" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:56–58)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    He said these things while teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:59)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Many Disciples Turn Back</h3>

  <p>
    Many of His disciples said,
    “This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?”
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were grumbling about this, said,
    “Does this offend you?
    Then what if you see the Son of Man ascending where He was before?
    It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no help at all.
    The words that I speak to you are spirit and are life”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v60" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:60–63)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “But there are some of you who do not believe.”
    For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe,
    and who would betray Him.
    He said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to Me
    unless it has been granted to him by the Father”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:64–65)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    From that time many of His disciples turned back
    and no longer walked with Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v66" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:66)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Peter’s Confession</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus said to the Twelve,
    “You don’t want to leave too, do you?”
  </p>

  <p>
    Simon Peter answered Him,
    “Lord, to whom will we go?
    You have the words of eternal life.
    We have believed and have come to know
    that You are the Holy One of God”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v67" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:67–69)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus answered,
    “Didn’t I choose you, the Twelve?
    And yet one of you is a devil.”
    He spoke of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot,
    for he, one of the Twelve, was going to betray Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v70" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:70–71)</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 6</h2>

  <h3>1. New Exodus: Feeding in the wilderness</h3>
  <p>
    John ties this sign to Passover
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:4)</a>.
    The crowd in the wilderness, the miraculous bread,
    the reference to Moses and manna
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EXO16.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Ex 16)</a>
    — this is New Exodus imagery.
    Jesus is the true Moses leading a New Covenant people,
    not to another physical land,
    but into New Creation life.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Twelve baskets = provision for the New Israel</h3>
  <p>
    The twelve baskets of leftovers
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:13)</a>
    are not just “extra food”;
    they picture abundance for the twelve-tribe people of God.
    In the fulfilled lens, Christ Himself is the overflowing supply for the New Israel —
    the New Covenant community, Jew and Gentile in Him.
  </p>

  <h3>3. They want a political king; He is the Bread of Life</h3>
  <p>
    The crowd wants to seize Him and make Him king
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:15)</a>.
    They’re still thinking in terms of an earthly, national Messiah.
    Jesus refuses that script.
    His kingdom is not another version of the old order;
    it is the New Creation reign of the crucified and risen Son.
  </p>

  <h3>4. “Work of God” = believe in the One He sent</h3>
  <p>
    When they ask, “What must we do?”
    Jesus answers:
    “This is the work of God: believe in the One He has sent”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:29)</a>.
    The New Covenant “work” is not Torah-performance,
    but trust in the One who fulfills Torah and brings the New Creation.
  </p>

  <h3>5. “I am the bread of life” = present New Creation sustenance</h3>
  <p>
    The manna sustained Israel temporarily, and they still died
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v49" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:49)</a>.
    Jesus, as the true bread, sustains New Creation life that does not perish
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:35)</a>.
    Eating this bread is not a future ritual;
    it is a present, ongoing participation in Christ by faith.
  </p>

  <h3>6. “Eat My flesh, drink My blood” = participate in His covenant death</h3>
  <p>
    The language is offensive because it shatters religious expectations.
    To “eat” and “drink” is covenant participation — sharing in His death and life
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO10.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(1 Cor 10:16)</a>.
    In the fulfilled frame, this is not cannibalism or mere liturgy;
    it is abiding union with the crucified and risen Christ,
    the core of New Creation existence.
  </p>

  <h3>7. “The words I speak are spirit and life”</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus explicitly de-fangs literalistic readings:
    “The flesh is of no help;
    the words I speak are spirit and life”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v63" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:63)</a>.
    The life is in His word, His person, His Spirit —
    not in material bread alone or in external rituals.
    New Creation life is Word-and-Spirit reality.
  </p>

  <h3>8. “Last day” in a fulfilled lens</h3>
  <p>
    “I will raise him up at the last day”
    occurs repeatedly
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:39–40, 44, 54)</a>.
    In a fulfilled eschatology frame,
    this is the last day of the old covenant age,
    not the last day of the physical cosmos:
    the climactic transition when the old world passes
    and the New Creation order stands revealed.
  </p>

  <h3>9. Peter’s confession anchors eternal life in Jesus’ words now</h3>
  <p>
    “You have the words of eternal life”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN06.htm#v68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 6:68)</a>.
    Eternal life is not mainly “what happens after we die”;
    it is the life of the age to come,
    now mediated through the Son’s words and presence.
    To remain with Him is to live in the New Creation reality already breaking into history.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 6 pulls the whole Exodus, manna, and temple story into focus:
    Jesus Himself is the true bread, true Moses, and true provision of the New Covenant.
    Life, judgment, and “the last day” all converge in Him
    and in the end of the old covenant world —
    leaving a New Creation people who feed on Him forever.
  </p>
