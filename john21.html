<h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
<h2>Chapter 21 — Restoration, Vocation, and the Life That Follows</h2>

<h3>Jesus Appears by the Sea</h3>

<p>
  After this Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples
  by the Sea of Tiberias,
  and He revealed Himself in this way.
  Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin,
  Nathanael of Cana in Galilee,
  the sons of Zebedee,
  and two others of His disciples were together.
  Simon Peter said to them,
  “I am going fishing.”
  They said to him,
  “We will go with you.”
  They went out and got into the boat,
  but that night they caught nothing
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:1–3)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Just as day was breaking,
  Jesus stood on the shore;
  yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
  Jesus said to them,
  “Children, do you have any fish?”
  They answered Him,
  “No.”
  He said to them,
  “Cast the net on the right side of the boat,
  and you will find some.”
  So they cast it,
  and now they were not able to haul it in,
  because of the quantity of fish
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:4–6)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter,
  “It is the Lord!”
  When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
  he put on his outer garment,
  for he was stripped for work,
  and threw himself into the sea.
  The other disciples came in the boat,
  dragging the net full of fish,
  for they were not far from the land,
  about a hundred yards off
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:7–8)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Breakfast With the Risen Lord</h3>

<p>
  When they got out on land,
  they saw a charcoal fire in place,
  with fish laid out on it, and bread.
  Jesus said to them,
  “Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.”
  So Simon Peter went aboard
  and hauled the net ashore,
  full of large fish, 153 of them.
  And although there were so many,
  the net was not torn.
  Jesus said to them,
  “Come and have breakfast.”
  Now none of the disciples dared ask Him,
  “Who are You?”
  They knew it was the Lord
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:9–12)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them,
  and so with the fish.
  This was now the third time
  that Jesus was revealed to the disciples
  after He was raised from the dead
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:13–14)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Peter Restored</h3>

<p>
  When they had finished breakfast,
  Jesus said to Simon Peter,
  “Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?”
  He said to Him,
  “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.”
  He said to him,
  “Feed My lambs.”
  He said to him a second time,
  “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?”
  He said to Him,
  “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.”
  He said to him,
  “Tend My sheep.”
  He said to him the third time,
  “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?”
  Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time,
  “Do you love Me?”
  And he said to Him,
  “Lord, You know everything;
  You know that I love You.”
  Jesus said to him,
  “Feed My sheep”
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:15–17)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Follow Me</h3>

<p>
  Jesus said,
  “Truly, truly, I say to you,
  when you were young,
  you used to dress yourself
  and walk wherever you wanted,
  but when you are old,
  you will stretch out your hands,
  and another will dress you
  and carry you where you do not want to go.”
  This He said to show
  by what kind of death
  Peter was to glorify God.
  And after saying this He said to him,
  “Follow Me”
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:18–19)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them,
  the one who also had leaned back against Him during the supper
  and had said,
  “Lord, who is it that is going to betray You?”
  When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus,
  “Lord, what about this man?”
  Jesus said to him,
  “If it is My will that he remain until I come,
  what is that to you?
  You follow Me!”
  So the saying spread abroad among the brothers
  that this disciple was not to die;
  yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die,
  but,
  “If it is My will that he remain until I come,
  what is that to you?”
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:20–23)</a>.
</p>

<h3>The Testimony Completed</h3>

<p>
  This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things,
  and who has written these things,
  and we know that his testimony is true.
  Now there are also many other things that Jesus did.
  Were every one of them to be written,
  I suppose that the world itself
  could not contain the books that would be written
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN21.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 21:24–25)</a>.

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 21</h2>

<h3>1. The risen Lord meets them in ordinary life</h3>
<p>
  Jesus does not appear in a temple or on a throne,
  but on a shoreline at daybreak.
  Resurrection life is not detached from daily work;
  it meets people where life continues.
</p>

<h3>2. Fruitfulness flows from recognition, not effort</h3>
<p>
  The empty nets echo earlier failure.
  Abundance comes only after recognition:
  “It is the Lord.”
  New Creation fruit flows from relationship,
  not self-directed striving.
</p>

<h3>3. Restoration replaces Peter’s denial, not with shame but trust</h3>
<p>
  Three affirmations mirror three denials.
  Jesus does not rehearse Peter’s failure;
  He entrusts him with care for others.
  Grace restores vocation, not just conscience.
</p>

<h3>4. Love is expressed through responsibility</h3>
<p>
  “Do you love Me?” is answered by “Feed My sheep.”
  In the New Creation,
  love for Christ is not measured by feeling
  but by participation in His care for people.
</p>

<h3>5. Following Jesus is personal, not comparative</h3>
<p>
  Peter’s question about another disciple is gently dismissed.
  Each calling unfolds differently.
  Comparison is excluded from New Creation life.
</p>

<h3>6. “If I will that he remain until I come” is time-bound language</h3>
<p>
  Jesus speaks within a first-century horizon.
  The concern is not speculative timelines,
  but faithfulness within one’s own calling.
  John closes without turning the Gospel into a calendar.
</p>

<h3>7. The Gospel ends with abundance, not closure</h3>
<p>
  John does not attempt to exhaust the story.
  The risen Christ continues to act,
  to send,
  and to give life.
  The New Creation is open-ended,
  lived forward rather than archived.
</p>

<p>
  John 21 is not an appendix by accident.
  It shows what life looks like after resurrection:
  restored people,
  renewed purpose,
  and ordinary days filled with the presence of the risen Lord.
