<h1>Prophecy Hub</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled in Christ · New Creation Framework</h2>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>How to Read Prophecy on This Site</strong><br />
  All prophetic language on this site is read from the far side of fulfilment.
  “Coming,” “near,” “soon,” “day,” “hope,” and “until” are covenantal,
  not indicators of delayed physical events.
  Prophecy announces divine action within history —
  its fulfilment is recognised in Christ and the establishment of the New Creation.
</div>

<p>
This hub exists to anchor every fulfilled claim made across the Bible section.
Whenever a passage alludes to prophecy,
it must link back to one of these fulfilled frameworks.
If a prophecy is implied and not linked, the page has failed its standard.
</p>

<h2>Core Fulfilled Prophecy Frameworks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="matt24.html">Matthew 24 — The End of the Age</a></strong><br />
    Jesus’ covenant judgment discourse.
    Explains “coming on the clouds,” “this generation,” and temple destruction
    as first-century fulfilment, not modern speculation.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><a href="luke21.html">Luke 21 — Days of Vengeance</a></strong><br />
    Parallel to Matthew 24, emphasising Jerusalem, not the end of the planet.
    Frames judgment as covenantal reckoning.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><a href="daniel.html">Daniel — Kingdom, Son of Man, and Time</a></strong><br />
    Explains symbolic beasts, the Son of Man,
    and time-statements fulfilled in Christ’s enthronement.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><a href="isaiah.html">Isaiah — New Heavens, New Earth, New Humanity</a></strong><br />
    Shows covenant-creation language,
    Zion imagery, and peace metaphors fulfilled in the New Covenant.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><a href="ezekiel37.html">Ezekiel 37 — Resurrection as Restoration</a></strong><br />
    Valley of dry bones explained as covenant restoration,
    not biological resurrection prediction.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><a href="psalms.html">Psalms — Enthronement and Rule</a></strong><br />
    Messianic kingship, judgment language,
    and “rule from Zion” fulfilled in Christ’s reign.
  </li>
</ul>

---

<h2>New Testament Prophecy Re-Readings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="1thess4.html">1 Thessalonians 4 — Presence, Not Escape</a></strong><br />
    Explains “caught up,” “meeting the Lord,”
    and resurrection language as royal arrival imagery.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><a href="2pet3.html">2 Peter 3 — Heavens and Earth</a></strong><br />
    Shows covenantal “creation” language,
    dissolving the myth of planetary destruction.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><a href="revelation.html">Revelation — Symbol, Judgment, Victory</a></strong><br />
    Apocalyptic imagery decoded through Old Testament symbolism
    and first-century fulfilment.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Mandatory Use Rule</h2>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Editorial Standard</strong><br />
  If a chapter on this site:
  <ul>
    <li>uses prophecy language</li>
    <li>claims fulfilment</li>
    <li>re-frames “coming,” “hope,” or “resurrection”</li>
  </ul>
  it must link to at least one relevant page in this Prophecy Hub.
  Absence of linkage indicates an incomplete or failed page.
</div>

<p>
This hub is not optional background material.
It is the interpretive spine of the Fulfilled Bible project.
