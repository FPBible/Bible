<h1>1 Corinthians 15</h1>
<h2>Resurrection and Victory · Explained, Not Predicted</h2>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Reading Frame (Mandatory)</strong><br />
  1 Corinthians 15 is not prophecy.
  Paul is not predicting a future resurrection event.
  He is explaining what resurrection <em>means</em>
  in light of Christ’s death, resurrection, reign,
  and the covenant transition already underway.
</div>

<h2>Why Paul Wrote This Chapter</h2>

<p>
Some in Corinth were denying resurrection.
Paul does not respond with speculation or timelines.
He responds by redefining resurrection
around Christ, covenant identity, and transformation.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:12)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Key Question</strong><br />
  The issue is not “When will bodies leave graves?”
  The issue is whether life in Christ truly overcomes death.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>1) Resurrection Begins with Christ, Not with Us</h2>

<p>
“If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:17)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Foundation</strong><br />
  Resurrection is grounded in Christ’s victory,
  not in the future experience of believers.
  Paul reasons from what has already happened.
</div>

<h2>2) Adam and Christ — Two Corporate Realities</h2>

<p>
“As in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:22)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Corporate Identity</strong><br />
  Adam and Christ are covenant heads.
  Death and life are conditions of belonging,
  not merely biological states.
</div>

<h2>3) “Each in His Own Order”</h2>

<p>
“Christ the firstfruits, then those who belong to Christ.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:23)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Order Explained</strong><br />
  Paul describes redemptive sequence,
  not a countdown.
  Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the new reality;
  participation follows within the same covenant age.
</div>

<h2>4) “Then Comes the End” — What End?</h2>

<p>
“Then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom…”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:24)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Critical Clarification</strong><br />
  “The end” is not the end of the planet.
  It is the end of hostile powers and covenant enemies.
  This aligns with Daniel, Psalms, and Matthew 24.
</div>

<h2>5) Christ Reigns Until…</h2>

<p>
“He must reign until He has put all enemies under His feet.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:25)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Psalm 110 Lens</strong><br />
  “Until” does not delay reign.
  It defines the period during which reign is exercised.
  Christ reigns now; enemies are being subdued.
</div>

<h2>6) “The Last Enemy Is Death”</h2>

<p>
“The last enemy to be destroyed is death.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:26)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Death Defined</strong><br />
  In covenant terms, death is separation from God’s life.
  Its destruction means exclusion and condemnation are removed.
  Paul does not say biological death vanishes from history.
</div>

<h2>7) “Resurrection of the Dead” — What Kind?</h2>

<p>
Paul asks:
“How are the dead raised? With what kind of body?”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:35)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Not a Resuscitation</strong><br />
  Paul explicitly rejects fleshly continuity.
  Resurrection is transformation, not reanimation.
</div>

<h2>8) Seed Imagery — Discontinuity and Change</h2>

<p>
“What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:36–38)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Key Insight</strong><br />
  The body that emerges is not the same as the body that dies.
  This demolishes literal corpse-based resurrection models.
</div>

<h2>9) Natural Body / Spiritual Body</h2>

<p>
“It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:44)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Spiritual ≠ Non-Real</strong><br />
  “Spiritual” means Spirit-animated,
  not immaterial.
  The contrast is covenantal, not physical.
</div>

<h2>10) “Flesh and Blood Cannot Inherit”</h2>

<p>
“Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:50)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Decisive Boundary</strong><br />
  The old covenant mode of existence
  cannot participate in the kingdom.
  Transformation is required — not postponement.
</div>

<h2>11) “We Will All Be Changed”</h2>

<p>
“We will all be changed, in a moment…”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:51–52)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Corporate Transition</strong><br />
  Paul speaks to his generation.
  The change refers to covenant status —
  from old creation to new —
  not a future mass disappearance.
</div>

<h2>12) Victory Announced, Not Deferred</h2>

<p>
“Death has been swallowed up in victory.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:54)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Isaiah Fulfilled</strong><br />
  Paul quotes Isaiah 25.
  Victory is declared as accomplished,
  not postponed.
</div>

<h2>13) Therefore… Present Faithfulness</h2>

<p>
“Therefore, be steadfast…”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO15.htm">(1 Cor 15:58)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Practical Conclusion</strong><br />
  Paul ends with ethics, not anticipation.
  Resurrection life produces present stability and purpose.
</div>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>1 Corinthians 15 explains resurrection; it does not predict it</li>
  <li>Resurrection is covenantal, corporate, and Christ-centred</li>
  <li>Death is defeated as separation and condemnation</li>
  <li>Transformation replaces postponement</li>
  <li>Victory is announced, not awaited</li>
</ul>

<p>
Resurrection is not something believers are waiting for.
It is the life they now live in Christ.
