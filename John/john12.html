  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 12 — The King Revealed and the Judgment of This World</h2>

  <h3>Mary Anoints Jesus</h3>

  <p>
    Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany,
    where Lazarus lived — the one He had raised from the dead.
    So they made Him a dinner there.
    Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:1–2)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mary took a pound of very expensive perfume,
    pure nard,
    anointed Jesus’ feet,
    and wiped His feet with her hair.
    The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:3)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples — the one who was about to betray Him —
    said,
    “Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii
    and given to the poor?”
    He said this not because he cared about the poor,
    but because he was a thief
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:4–6)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus said,
    “Leave her alone.
    She has kept it for the day of My burial.
    For you always have the poor with you,
    but you do not always have Me”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:7–8)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Plot Against Lazarus</h3>

  <p>
    A large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there,
    and they came,
    not only because of Jesus,
    but also to see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.
    So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well,
    because on account of him many Jews were going away
    and believing in Jesus
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:9–11)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The King Enters Jerusalem</h3>

  <p>
    The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast
    heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
    They took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him,
    crying out,
    “Hosanna!
    Blessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord —
    the King of Israel!”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:12–13)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it,
    just as it is written:
    “Do not fear, daughter of Zion;
    behold, your King is coming,
    seated on a donkey’s colt”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ZEC09.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Zech 9:9)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:14–15)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    His disciples did not understand these things at first,
    but when Jesus was glorified,
    then they remembered that these things had been written about Him
    and had been done to Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:16)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Greeks Seek Jesus</h3>

  <p>
    Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks.
    They came to Philip and said,
    “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”
    Philip went and told Andrew,
    and Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:20–22)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus answered them,
    “The hour has come
    for the Son of Man to be glorified.
    Amen, amen, I tell you:
    unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies,
    it remains alone;
    but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
    The one who loves his life loses it,
    and the one who hates his life in this world
    will keep it for eternal life”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:23–25)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me;
    and where I am, there My servant will be also.
    If anyone serves Me,
    the Father will honor him”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:26)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Judgment of This World</h3>

  <p>
    “Now My soul is troubled.
    And what shall I say?
    ‘Father, save Me from this hour’?
    But for this purpose I came to this hour.
    Father, glorify Your name.”
    Then a voice came from heaven:
    “I have glorified it,
    and I will glorify it again”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:27–28)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The crowd that stood there and heard it said it had thundered.
    Others said, “An angel has spoken to Him.”
    Jesus answered,
    “This voice has not come for My sake,
    but for yours.
    Now is the judgment of this world;
    now the ruler of this world will be cast out.
    And I, when I am lifted up from the earth,
    will draw all people to Myself.”
    He said this to show by what kind of death He was going to die
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:29–33)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The crowd answered,
    “We have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever.
    How can You say that the Son of Man must be lifted up?
    Who is this Son of Man?”
    Jesus said,
    “The light is among you for a little while longer.
    Walk while you have the light,
    so darkness does not overtake you.
    The one who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.
    While you have the light, believe in the light,
    so that you may become sons of light”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:34–36)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Unbelief Fulfilled</h3>

  <p>
    Though He had done so many signs before them,
    they still did not believe in Him,
    so that the word spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled:
    “Lord, who has believed our report,
    and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
    Therefore they could not believe,
    because Isaiah also said,
    “He has blinded their eyes
    and hardened their hearts,
    so that they would not see with their eyes
    and understand with their hearts and turn,
    and I would heal them.”
    Isaiah said these things because he saw His glory and spoke of Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA53.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Isa 53:1)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA06.htm#v10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Isa 6:10)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v37" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:37–41)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nevertheless, many even of the authorities believed in Him,
    but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it,
    so that they would not be put out of the synagogue.
    For they loved the glory that comes from man
    more than the glory that comes from God
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:42–43)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Jesus’ Final Public Call</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus cried out and said,
    “Whoever believes in Me does not believe in Me only,
    but in the One who sent Me.
    And whoever sees Me sees the One who sent Me.
    I have come as Light into the world,
    so that whoever believes in Me may not remain in darkness.
    If anyone hears My words and does not keep them,
    I do not judge him;
    for I did not come to judge the world,
    but to save the world.
    The one who rejects Me and does not receive My words
    has a judge:
    the word I have spoken will judge him on the last day.
    For I have not spoken on My own authority,
    but the Father who sent Me
    has given Me commandment —
    what to say and what to speak.
    And I know that His commandment is eternal life.
    What I speak, therefore,
    I speak just as the Father has told Me”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:44–50)</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 12</h2>

  <h3>1. Anointing prepares the King for burial, not delay</h3>
  <p>
    Mary anoints Jesus not for coronation,
    but for burial
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:7)</a>.
    The kingdom arrives through death,
    not postponement.
    This destroys every futurist expectation
    of a delayed reign.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Palm branches proclaim a present King</h3>
  <p>
    “King of Israel”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:13)</a>
    is not irony.
    It is truth.
    Jesus enters Jerusalem already as King,
    fulfilling Zechariah,
    not auditioning for a throne.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Greeks signal the universal New Creation</h3>
  <p>
    Greeks seeking Jesus
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:20)</a>
    trigger the declaration:
    “The hour has come.”
    This marks the expansion of the covenant beyond Israel
    into a unified people of God.
  </p>

  <h3>4. “Now is the judgment of this world” means now</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus does not say judgment is coming later.
    He says:
    “Now is the judgment of this world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:31)</a>.
    The “world” is the old covenant order.
    Its ruler — the accusing power behind it —
    is being cast out.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Lifted up = enthroned through crucifixion</h3>
  <p>
    Being “lifted up”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:32)</a>
    is both death and exaltation.
    The cross is the throne.
    From there,
    Jesus draws all people into the New Creation.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Isaiah’s blindness is covenantal, not arbitrary</h3>
  <p>
    Isaiah’s prophecy
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA06.htm#v10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Isa 6:10)</a>
    is fulfilled as judicial hardening.
    This is not random unbelief;
    it is the necessary closing of the old age
    so that the New Creation may stand revealed.
  </p>

  <h3>7. The “last day” is the end of the old world</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus says His word will judge on “the last day”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN12.htm#v48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 12:48)</a>.
    In a fulfilled reading,
    this is the last day of the old covenant age,
    not the end of the physical universe.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 12 is the public closing argument.
    The King is revealed.
    Judgment is announced.
    The old world is exposed and condemned.
    The New Creation stands at the door —
    and the cross will open it.
  </p>
