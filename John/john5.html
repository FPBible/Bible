  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 5 — Life in the Son and Judgment of the Old Order</h2>

  <h3>The Healing at Bethesda</h3>

  <p>
    After these things there was a festival of the Jews,
    and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
    In Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, is a pool called Bethesda,
    which has five colonnades
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:1–2)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A great number of sick, blind, lame, and withered people lay there.
    One man had been sick thirty-eight years.
    When Jesus saw him lying there and knew he had been in that condition a long time,
    He said, “Do you want to be made well?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:3–6)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The man answered,
    “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred.
    While I’m coming, someone else goes down before me.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus said,
    “Get up, take up your mat, and walk.”
    Immediately the man was made well,
    took up his mat, and walked
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:8–9)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now that day was a Sabbath.
    So the Jews said to the man who was healed,
    “It’s the Sabbath; you are not allowed to carry your mat.”
    He answered, “The One who healed me told me, ‘Take up your mat and walk.’”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:10–11)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later Jesus found him in the temple and said,
    “See, you have been made well. Stop sinning so nothing worse happens to you.”
    The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who healed him.
    So the Jews persecuted Jesus because He had done these things on the Sabbath
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:12–16)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Jesus Claims Equality with the Father</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus answered them,
    “My Father is working until now, and I am working.”
    This made the Jews seek even more to kill Him,
    not only because He broke the Sabbath,
    but because He called God His own Father,
    making Himself equal with God
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:17–18)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus said to them,
    “Amen, amen, I tell you,
    the Son can do nothing by Himself,
    but only what He sees the Father doing;
    for whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.
    For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all He does.
    And greater works than these He will show Him,
    so that you may marvel”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:19–20)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Father Gives Life to the Son</h3>

  <p>
    “For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life,
    so also the Son gives life to whom He wills.
    The Father judges no one,
    but has given all judgment to the Son,
    that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:21–23)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Amen, amen, I tell you,
    whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me
    *has* eternal life
    and *is not* judged,
    but has passed out of death into life”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:24)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Hour Has Come — Resurrection and Judgment</h3>

  <p>
    “Amen, amen, I tell you,
    the hour is coming — and now is —
    when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God,
    and those who hear will live”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:25)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “For as the Father has life in Himself,
    so He has given the Son to have life in Himself,
    and He has given Him authority to execute judgment,
    because He is the Son of Man”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:26–27)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Do not marvel at this,
    for an hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear His voice
    and come out —
    those who have done good to a resurrection of life,
    those who have practiced evil to a resurrection of judgment”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:28–29)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Witnesses to Jesus</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus continues:
    “I can do nothing on My own; I judge only as I hear,
    and My judgment is just,
    because I seek not My own will
    but the will of Him who sent Me”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:30)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    He speaks of John the Baptist as a burning, shining lamp,
    but says the testimony He has is greater than John:
    the works the Father has given Him testify about Him,
    as does the Father Himself.
    Yet the Jews refuse to hear God’s voice or see His form,
    though they search the Scriptures
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:31–39)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “You search the Scriptures because you think you have eternal life in them;
    yet they testify about Me,
    and you refuse to come to Me to have life”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:39–40)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus exposes their unbelief and declares that Moses himself
    — the one they trust —
    actually accuses them,
    because Moses wrote about Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v45" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:45–47)</a>.

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 5</h2>

  <h3>1. The healed man represents Israel under the old system</h3>
  <p>
    Thirty-eight years echoes Israel’s wilderness wandering.
    The man at the pool is symbolic of Israel stuck under the old covenant,
    waiting for a “stirring” that never truly heals.
    Jesus bypasses the old system entirely and heals by His own authority
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:8–9)</a>.
    This anticipates the New Creation replacing the old order.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Jesus’ Sabbath “breaking” signals the end of old covenant boundaries</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus doesn’t break God’s law;
    He breaks the rabbinic fence around it.
    His “working” on the Sabbath declares that the true Sabbath rest is found in Him,
    not in calendar restrictions
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL02.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Col 2:16–17)</a>.
    The old covenant Sabbath is fading; the New Creation rest is dawning.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Jesus openly claims equality with God</h3>
  <p>
    The Jews understand the claim:
    Jesus makes Himself equal with God
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:18)</a>.
    In a fulfilled reading, this is not preparation for a later enthronement:
    He is already operating with divine authority in their midst.
  </p>

  <h3>4. “Has passed from death to life” is **present tense**</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus says believers *already* possess eternal life
    and *already* have passed out of death into life
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:24)</a>.
    This is resurrection life of the New Creation, not a postponed future reward.
  </p>

  <h3>5. “The hour... now is” — resurrection and judgment are happening in Jesus’ ministry</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus says:
    “The hour is coming — *and now is* —
    when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:25)</a>.
    This is covenantal resurrection:
    Israel coming out of spiritual death into Christ’s life.
    The final separation (life/judgment) is tied to the end of the old age,
    not the end of the physical universe.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Jesus is the Judge of the old world</h3>
  <p>
    Judgment has been entrusted to the Son
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:22)</a>.
    In the fulfilled frame:
    He judges the old covenant world,
    bringing it to its appointed end (AD 70),
    while simultaneously inaugurating the New Creation kingdom.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Moses accuses those who reject Jesus</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus says Moses himself will accuse the unbelieving Jews
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN05.htm#v45" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 5:45)</a>.
    The very law they trust exposes their blindness,
    because it pointed to Christ the whole time.
    This is the covenant lawsuit against old Israel,
    fulfilled in the transition of the ages.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 5 reveals Jesus as the Life-giver, Judge, and fulfillment of Torah.
    Resurrection life is already flowing in Him,
    and the old world is already under His verdict.
