  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 11 — I Am the Resurrection and the Life</h2>

  <h3>The Death of Lazarus</h3>

  <p>
    Now a man named Lazarus was sick.
    He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
    Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with perfume
    and wiped His feet with her hair.
    Her brother Lazarus was sick.
    So the sisters sent word to Jesus, saying,
    “Lord, the one You love is sick”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:1–3)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Jesus heard this, He said,
    “This sickness is not to end in death,
    but for the glory of God,
    so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”
    Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
    Yet when He heard Lazarus was sick,
    He stayed where He was two more days
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:4–6)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>“I Am Glad I Was Not There”</h3>

  <p>
    Then after this He said to the disciples,
    “Let us go to Judea again.”
    The disciples said,
    “Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone You,
    and You’re going back there?”
    Jesus answered,
    “Are there not twelve hours in the day?
    If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble,
    because he sees the light of this world.
    But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles,
    because the light is not in him”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:7–10)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    He said these things, and then told them,
    “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep,
    but I am going to awaken him.”
    The disciples said,
    “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”
    Jesus had spoken of his death,
    but they thought He meant ordinary sleep.
    Then Jesus told them plainly,
    “Lazarus is dead.
    And I am glad for your sake that I was not there,
    so that you may believe.
    But let us go to him”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:11–15)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples,
    “Let us also go, so that we may die with Him”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:16)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Jesus the Resurrection</h3>

  <p>
    When Jesus arrived, He found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days.
    Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away,
    and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary
    to comfort them concerning their brother
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:17–19)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Martha heard Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him.
    Mary stayed at home.
    Martha said,
    “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.
    But even now I know that whatever You ask from God,
    God will give You.”
    Jesus said,
    “Your brother will rise again.”
    Martha said,
    “I know he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:20–24)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus said to her,
    “I am the resurrection and the life.
    Whoever believes in Me, though he dies, yet shall he live.
    And everyone who lives and believes in Me
    shall never die.
    Do you believe this?”
    She said,
    “Yes, Lord.
    I believe that You are the Christ,
    the Son of God,
    the One coming into the world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:25–27)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Jesus Weeps</h3>

  <p>
    When Mary came where Jesus was and saw Him,
    she fell at His feet and said,
    “Lord, if You had been here,
    my brother would not have died.”
    When Jesus saw her weeping,
    and the Jews who came with her also weeping,
    He was deeply moved and troubled.
    He said,
    “Where have you laid him?”
    They said,
    “Lord, come and see.”
    Jesus wept
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:32–35)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jews said,
    “See how He loved him!”
    But some said,
    “Couldn’t this man, who opened the eyes of the blind,
    have kept this man from dying?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v36" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:36–37)</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Lazarus Raised</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb.
    It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
    Jesus said,
    “Take away the stone.”
    Martha said,
    “Lord, by this time there will be a stench,
    for he has been dead four days.”
    Jesus said,
    “Did I not tell you that if you believed,
    you would see the glory of God?”
    So they took away the stone
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:38–41)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus lifted up His eyes and said,
    “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.
    I knew that You always hear Me,
    but I said this on account of the people standing around,
    that they may believe You sent Me.”
    When He had said these things,
    He cried out with a loud voice,
    “Lazarus, come out!”
    The man who had died came out,
    his hands and feet bound with linen strips,
    and his face wrapped with a cloth.
    Jesus said,
    “Unbind him, and let him go”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v41" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:41–44)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Plot to Kill Jesus</h3>

  <p>
    Many of the Jews who had come with Mary and saw what He did believed in Him.
    But some went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
    The chief priests and Pharisees gathered the council and said,
    “What are we doing?
    This man performs many signs.
    If we let Him go on like this,
    everyone will believe in Him,
    and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v45" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:45–48)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Caiaphas, the high priest that year, said,
    “You know nothing at all.
    Nor do you understand that it is better for you
    that one man should die for the people,
    and that the whole nation not perish.”
    He did not say this on his own,
    but being high priest that year,
    he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation —
    and not for the nation only,
    but also to gather into one
    the children of God who are scattered abroad
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v49" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:49–52)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    So from that day on they planned to put Him to death.
    Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews,
    but went from there to the region near the wilderness,
    to a town called Ephraim,
    and there He stayed with the disciples
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v53" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:53–54)</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 11</h2>

  <h3>1. Lazarus is a sign, not the main point</h3>
  <p>
    The raising of Lazarus is the final and greatest sign in John’s Gospel
    before the cross.
    It is not primarily about proving power,
    but about revealing what Jesus already declared:
    resurrection life is present in Him now
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:25)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>2. “Last day” thinking meets present reality</h3>
  <p>
    Martha expects resurrection “on the last day”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:24)</a>.
    Jesus redirects her from timetable theology
    to person-centered reality:
    “I am the resurrection.”
    Fulfilled eschatology reads this as covenantal —
    the life of the age to come embodied in Christ before AD 70.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Jesus weeps over death — and over Jerusalem</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus’ tears are not weakness.
    They are prophetic grief.
    He stands at a tomb while knowing
    the city that will soon reject Him
    is itself headed toward judgment and death.
    Compassion and judgment meet here.
  </p>

  <h3>4. “Unbind him” — life without grave clothes</h3>
  <p>
    Lazarus comes out alive
    but still wrapped in burial cloths
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:44)</a>.
    This mirrors Israel’s transition:
    alive in Christ,
    yet still needing release from old covenant bindings.
    The New Creation calls people not just to life,
    but to freedom.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Caiaphas unknowingly prophesies the New Covenant</h3>
  <p>
    Caiaphas speaks better than he knows
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm#v50" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 11:50)</a>.
    One Man dies for the people —
    not merely to save a nation,
    but to gather a single, unified people of God
    across covenant and ethnic lines.
    This is the theological hinge of the Gospel.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Resurrection triggers the death sentence</h3>
  <p>
    Lazarus’ resurrection seals Jesus’ fate.
    The sign forces a decision:
    either the old world yields,
    or it kills the Life-giver.
    From here on,
    the cross is inevitable,
    and with it the end of the old covenant order.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 11 declares the core New Creation truth:
    resurrection is not postponed.
    It is present in the Son.
    Those who believe have already crossed
    from death into life —
    and the old world cannot survive that reality.
