<h1>Colossians</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1 — The Supremacy of Christ and the Reconciled World</h2>

<h3>1) Opening: Grace, Peace, and a People “in Christ”</h3>
<p>
  Paul, appointed by God’s will, writes with Timothy to the holy and faithful in Colossae—people defined by Christ, not by lineage, temple, or a religious status game. Grace and peace to you from God our Father.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:1–2)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Faith, Love, and Hope: The Gospel Produces Fruit</h3>
<p>
  We keep thanking God as we pray for you, because we hear of your faith in Christ and your love for all the saints. That love isn’t sentimental—it's the overflow of a hope already stored for you in the heavenly realm, the hope you heard in the true message of the gospel.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:3–5)</a>
</p>
<p>
  This gospel isn’t local. It’s bearing fruit and growing throughout the world, just as it did among you from the day you truly understood God’s grace. You learned it from Epaphras, a faithful servant, who also told us about your Spirit-shaped love.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:6–8)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) A Prayer for Clear Sight and Real Strength</h3>
<p>
  Since the day we heard, we haven’t stopped praying that you’d be filled with the knowledge of God’s will—with wisdom and understanding from the Spirit—so your life actually matches the Lord: fruitful, grounded, and genuinely pleasing to Him.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:9–10)</a>
</p>
<p>
  May you be strengthened with power according to His glory—so you endure with patience and joy. This isn’t clenched-teeth religion; it’s Spirit-enabled stability.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:11)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) Delivered, Transferred, and Redeemed — Already</h3>
<p>
  Give thanks to the Father: He has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has rescued us from the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son He loves—where redemption is real, and sins are released.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:12–14)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) The Son: God Revealed Without Remainder</h3>
<p>
  The Son is the visible expression of the invisible God—the “firstborn” over all creation (supreme in rank and authority, not a created being).
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:15)</a>
</p>
<p>
  All things were created in Him, through Him, and for Him—heaven and earth, visible and invisible, including thrones, dominions, rulers, and authorities. He existed before all things, and in Him all things hold together.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:16–17)</a>
</p>
<p>
  He is the head of the body—the covenant community. He is the beginning, the first to rise out from death, so He holds first place in everything.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:18)</a>
</p>
<p>
  All fullness was pleased to dwell in Him, and through Him God reconciled all things to Himself, making peace through the blood of His cross—things on earth and things in heaven.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:19–20)</a>
</p>

<h3>6) Reconciled: Holy, Blameless, and Beyond Accusation</h3>
<p>
  You were once alienated and hostile in your thinking, entangled in destructive ways. But now He has reconciled you through Christ’s physical death to present you holy, blameless, and beyond accusation.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:21–22)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Stay grounded and settled in the hope of the gospel—don’t drift back into identity systems that rebuild fear and accusation. This gospel has been proclaimed openly, and Paul became its servant to deliver it fully.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:23)</a>
</p>

<h3>7) The Mystery Revealed: Christ in You</h3>
<p>
  Paul says his sufferings serve the body, because his assignment is to fully make known God’s word—the mystery hidden through ages and generations, now revealed to God’s people.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:24–26)</a>
</p>
<p>
  And here is the mystery stated plainly: Christ in you—the hope of glory. Not Christ far away. Not Christ delayed. Christ present within His people.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:27)</a>
</p>
<p>
  So we proclaim Him—warning and teaching everyone with wisdom—so every person may stand complete in Christ. This is what Paul works for, striving by the power already at work in him.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:28–29)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Colossians 1</h2>

<h3>1) “Firstborn” means supremacy, not “created”</h3>
<p>
  Paul’s point is rank and inheritance authority: Christ stands over creation as its source, aim, and ruler. The passage doesn’t demote Him; it exalts Him.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:15–18)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) “Transferred into the kingdom” is present reality</h3>
<p>
  Paul speaks in completed terms: rescued, transferred, redeemed. That’s New-Covenant location now—not a postponed destination.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:12–14)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) Reconciliation is objective peace, not religious mood</h3>
<p>
  “Peace through the blood of His cross” is not inner calm achieved by effort. It’s the ending of hostility and the removal of accusation as the operating system.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:19–22)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) “Christ in you” is the New-Creation centre</h3>
<p>
  The mystery isn’t secret knowledge. It’s unveiled union: God’s presence no longer housed in a building-system, but carried in a people.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:26–27)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) “Complete in Christ” is maturity inside a finished work</h3>
<p>
  Paul’s labour isn’t to push performance. It’s to bring people to settled completeness—whole standing, whole access, whole identity in the Son.
  <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:28–29)</a>
</p>

<p>
  Colossians 1 sets the baseline: the Kingdom is present, the Son is supreme, reconciliation is done, and “Christ in you” is not poetry—it’s the lived environment of the New Creation.
