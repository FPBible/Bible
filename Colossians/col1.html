<h1>Colossians</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1 — The Son, the New Creation, and Finished Reconciliation</h2>

<p>
Paul, an apostle by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,  
to the holy and faithful people in Colossae, who live in Christ.  
Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:1–2)</a>
</p>

<p>
We continually thank God when we pray for you, because we hear of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all God’s people.  
This love flows from the hope already laid up for you in the heavenly realm — the hope you heard about in the true message of the gospel.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:3–5)</a>
</p>

<p>
This gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the world, just as it has among you since the day you truly understood the grace of God.  
You learned it from Epaphras, a faithful servant of Christ, who also told us about your love produced by the Spirit.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:6–8)</a>
</p>

<h3>A Prayer for Understanding and Strength</h3>

<p>
For this reason, we have not stopped praying that you would be filled with the knowledge of God’s will, with all spiritual wisdom and understanding,  
so that your life reflects the Lord — bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:9–10)</a>
</p>

<p>
May you be strengthened with all power according to His glorious might, resulting in endurance, patience, and joy.  
Give thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:11–12)</a>
</p>

<p>
He has rescued us from the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son He loves,  
in whom we have redemption — the release from sins.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:13–14)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Supremacy of the Son</h3>

<p>
The Son is the visible image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.  
He holds authority and rank over everything that exists.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:15)</a>
</p>

<p>
All things were created in Him, through Him, and for Him — things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,  
whether thrones, dominions, rulers, or authorities.  
He existed before all things, and in Him all things hold together.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:16–17)</a>
</p>

<p>
He is the head of the body — the covenant community.  
He is the beginning, the first to rise out from death, so that He holds first place in everything.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:18)</a>
</p>

<p>
All fullness was pleased to dwell in Him,  
and through Him God reconciled all things to Himself,  
making peace through the blood of His cross — things on earth and things in heaven.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:19–20)</a>
</p>

<h3>Reconciled and Made Whole</h3>

<p>
You were once alienated and hostile in your thinking, entangled in destructive ways.  
But now He has reconciled you through Christ’s physical death,  
to present you holy, blameless, and beyond accusation.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:21–22)</a>
</p>

<p>
Remain grounded and settled in the hope of the gospel, not shifting back into old identity systems.  
This gospel has been openly proclaimed, and I, Paul, have become its servant.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:23)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Mystery Revealed</h3>

<p>
I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, because they serve the body — the community called out by God.  
My commission is to fully proclaim God’s word: the mystery hidden through ages and generations, now revealed to His people.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:24–26)</a>
</p>

<p>
That mystery is this: Christ in you — the hope of glory.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:27)</a>
</p>

<p>
We proclaim Him, instructing and warning everyone with wisdom, so that every person may stand complete in Christ.  
For this purpose I labour, striving according to His power that is already at work in me.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:28–29)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Colossians 1</h2>

<p>
Colossians 1 establishes the New Creation baseline.  
Paul is not motivating believers toward a future status; he is anchoring them in a completed transition.
</p>

<p>
The language of rescue, transfer, reconciliation, and indwelling presence is all past and present tense.
This chapter leaves no room for a delayed Kingdom or a postponed identity.
</p>

<p>
“Firstborn” announces supremacy, not origin.  
“All fullness” dismantles every religious system that assumes Christ is incomplete.  
“Reconciled all things” signals the end of covenantal division between heaven and earth.
</p>

<p>
Most critically, the mystery is not information, prophecy, or timetable.  
It is presence.  
God no longer dwells in structures, systems, or shadows.  
He dwells in people.
</p>

<p>
Colossians 1 prepares the reader for what follows.  
If Christ is this complete, this present, and this sufficient, then religious add-ons cannot survive.  
Chapter 2 will make that explicit.
