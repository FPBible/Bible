<h1>Ephesians</h1>

<h2>Chapter 4 — One Body, One Calling, One New Humanity in Practice</h2>

<h3>Walk Worthy of the Calling</h3>

<p>
Therefore, I urge you — as one imprisoned because of the Lord —
to walk in a manner worthy of the calling you have received,
with all humility and gentleness,
with patience, bearing with one another in love,
eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:1–3)</a>
</p>

<p>
There is one body and one Spirit,
just as you were called to one hope of your calling;
one Lord, one faith, one baptism;
one God and Father of all,
who is over all and through all and in all.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:4–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>Grace Given for Growth</h3>

<p>
But grace was given to each one of us
according to the measure of Christ’s gift.
Therefore it says:
“When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive,
and He gave gifts to people.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:7–8)</a>
</p>

<p>
Now what does “He ascended” mean
except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth?
The One who descended is the same One who ascended
far above all the heavens,
so that He might fill all things.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:9–10)</a>
</p>

<p>
He gave some as apostles,
some as prophets,
some as evangelists,
and some as shepherds and teachers,
to equip the saints for the work of service,
for building up the body of Christ,
until we all reach unity of the faith
and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
growing into maturity,
to the measure of the full stature of Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:11–13)</a>
</p>

<h3>Maturity, Not Instability</h3>

<p>
Then we will no longer be children,
tossed back and forth by waves
and carried about by every wind of teaching,
by human trickery,
by craftiness in deceitful schemes.
Instead, speaking the truth in love,
we grow up in every way into Him who is the head — Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:14–15)</a>
</p>

<p>
From Him the whole body,
joined and held together by every supporting ligament,
grows and builds itself up in love,
as each part does its work.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:16)</a>
</p>

<h3>Put Off the Old Way, Put On the New</h3>

<p>
So I say this and affirm it in the Lord:
you must no longer walk as the nations walk,
in the futility of their thinking.
They are darkened in understanding,
alienated from the life of God
because of the ignorance in them,
due to the hardness of their hearts.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:17–18)</a>
</p>

<p>
They have become callous
and have given themselves over to unchecked behaviour
to practice every kind of impurity with greed.
But that is not how you learned Christ,
if indeed you heard Him and were taught in Him,
as the truth is in Jesus.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:19–21)</a>
</p>

<p>
You were taught to put off the old person,
which belongs to your former way of life
and is corrupted by deceitful desires,
to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
and to put on the new person,
created according to God
in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:22–24)</a>
</p>

<h3>New Creation Conduct</h3>

<p>
Therefore, put away falsehood
and speak truth each one with his neighbour,
because we are members of one another.
Be angry and do not sin;
do not let the sun go down on your anger,
and do not give the accuser an opportunity.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:25–27)</a>
</p>

<p>
Let the one who stole steal no longer,
but rather work,
doing good with their own hands,
so that they may have something to share with anyone in need.
Let no corrupt talk come out of your mouths,
but only what is good for building up,
as fits the need,
so that it gives grace to those who hear.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:28–29)</a>
</p>

<p>
Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,
by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness, rage, anger, shouting, and slander
be put away from you, along with all malice.
Be kind to one another, tenderhearted,
forgiving one another,
just as God in Christ forgave you.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:30–32)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Ephesians 4</h2>

<h3>1) “Walk worthy” flows from identity, not obligation</h3>
<p>
Paul does not introduce a new law-code.
He appeals to alignment: live in a way that matches the calling already received.
Worthiness here is congruence, not merit.
New Creation ethics are identity-shaped, not fear-driven.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:1)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Unity is created by the Spirit, not negotiated by people</h3>
<p>
Paul does not tell them to manufacture unity.
He tells them to keep it.
Unity exists because there is one God, one Lord, one Spirit.
Division always begins when something else is allowed to define identity.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:3–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) Gifts are functional, not positional</h3>
<p>
Apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers are not ranks.
They are Christ’s gifts to serve growth.
The goal is maturity of the whole body,
not dependence on spiritual specialists.
If gifts produce passivity or hierarchy, they are being misused.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:11–13)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) Maturity protects the community from manipulation</h3>
<p>
Paul contrasts maturity with instability.
Children are easily carried by trends and clever arguments.
Maturity grows from truth spoken in love and shared participation in Christ.
New Creation communities are stabilised by relationship, not control.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:14–16)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) The “old person” is a former identity system</h3>
<p>
Putting off the old person is not suppressing behaviour.
It is rejecting the identity formed under ignorance, deceit, and futility.
Renewal happens in the mind — the inner narrative that tells you who you are.
Put on the new person means live from what God has already created in Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:22–24)</a>
</p>

<h3>6) New Creation ethics are relational before they are moral</h3>
<p>
Paul grounds ethics in belonging:
“we are members of one another.”
Truth, restraint, generosity, speech, forgiveness —
all of it flows from shared life.
Sin fractures community; love restores it.
This is holiness as relational integrity, not rule-keeping.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:25–29)</a>
</p>

<h3>7) “Do not grieve the Spirit” means do not violate shared life</h3>
<p>
The Spirit seals the community.
Grieving the Spirit is not about accidental missteps;
it is about actions that tear at the unity and life of the body.
Bitterness and malice fracture what forgiveness heals.
The Spirit’s work is relational, so the grief is relational.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:30–32)</a>
</p>

<p>
Ephesians 4 marks the shift from New Creation identity to New Creation practice.
Nothing here is law revived.
Everything here is life aligned.
Unity guarded, maturity pursued, love embodied.
