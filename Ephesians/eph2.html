<h1>Ephesians</h1>
<h2>Chapter 2 — One New Humanity</h2>

<p><em>
Ephesians 2 describes a present covenant change — death to life,
exclusion to inclusion, and full access to God established now in Christ.
</em></p>

<h3>From Death to Life</h3>

<p>
You were dead in your trespasses and sins,
walking according to the age of this world,
according to the ruler of the authority of the air —
the spirit now at work in those characterised by disobedience.
Among them we all once lived,
carrying out the desires shaped by the flesh and the mind,
and were by nature children marked out for wrath,
like the rest.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:1–3)</a>
</p>

<p>
But God, being rich in mercy,
because of the great love with which He loved us,
made us alive together with Christ
even when we were dead in our trespasses —
by grace you have been rescued.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:4–5)</a>
</p>

<h3>Raised and Seated — Now</h3>

<p>
He raised us up together with Him
and seated us together with Him
in the heavenly realm in Christ Jesus,
so that in the unfolding New Covenant age
He might display the surpassing riches of His grace
in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:6–7)</a>
</p>

<p>
For by grace you have been rescued through faith —
and this is not from yourselves;
it is God’s gift —
not from works,
so that no one may boast.
For we are His workmanship,
created in Christ Jesus for good works,
which God prepared beforehand
that we should walk in them.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:8–10)</a>
</p>

<h3>From Exclusion to Inclusion</h3>

<p>
Therefore remember that formerly you —
the nations according to the flesh,
called “uncircumcision” by those who call themselves “circumcision”
— were at that time without Christ,
excluded from the citizenship of Israel,
strangers to the covenants of promise,
having no hope and without God in the world.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:11–12)</a>
</p>

<p>
But now, in Christ Jesus,
you who once were far away
have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
For He Himself is our peace,
who made both groups one
and broke down the dividing wall of hostility.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:13–14)</a>
</p>

<h3>The End of the Dividing Wall</h3>

<p>
By abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments
expressed in ordinances,
He created in Himself one new humanity in place of the two,
making peace,
and reconciled both to God in one body through the cross,
thereby putting hostility to death.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:15–16)</a>
</p>

<p>
He came and proclaimed peace
to those far away and peace to those near,
for through Him we both have access
in one Spirit to the Father.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:17–18)</a>
</p>

<h3>A Dwelling Place for God</h3>

<p>
So then you are no longer strangers and aliens,
but fellow citizens with the saints
and members of God’s household,
built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone,
in whom the whole structure,
being joined together,
grows into a holy temple in the Lord.
In Him you also are being built together
into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:19–22)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Ephesians 2</h2>

<h3>1) “Dead” and “alive” are covenant realities</h3>
<p>
Paul is not describing biological corpses.
Death here is separation from covenant life;
life is restored relationship.
This is why the change can happen “now” and “together with Christ.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:1–5)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Heavenly seating is shared authority, not a future location</h3>
<p>
To be seated with Christ means to share His rule and status.
This is a statement of present identity,
not a promise of post-mortem geography.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:6)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) Grace rescues into purpose, not passivity</h3>
<p>
Grace does not erase responsibility;
it establishes it.
The New Creation walks in works prepared,
not to earn life,
but because life has been given.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:8–10)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) The dividing wall was covenantal, not architectural</h3>
<p>
Paul’s wall is not masonry.
It is the law that defined insider and outsider.
By abolishing it, Christ did not erase holiness —
He redefined it around Himself.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:14–16)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) The temple is now personal and corporate</h3>
<p>
God’s dwelling is no longer tied to a location.
He inhabits a reconciled people.
This completes the movement from tabernacle,
to temple,
to living community.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH02.htm">(Eph 2:19–22)</a>
</p>

<p>
Ephesians 2 announces the death of exclusion
and the birth of one new humanity —
not waiting to arrive,
but already living from reconciliation.
